## Prerequisites

- Gemini CLI installed
- Jira MCP server configured
- Optional: `gh` CLI tools installed and configured, for GitHub access.

### Setting up Jira MCP Server

**Option 1: Podman container (recommended if you already have Podman)**

```bash
# Start the atlassian mcp server using podman
podman run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 -e "JIRA_URL=https://redhat.atlassian.net" -e "JIRA_USERNAME" -e "JIRA_API_TOKEN" ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest --transport sse --port 8080 -vv
```

Then add it to Gemini as an SSE server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse jira http://localhost:8080/sse
```

**Option 2: uvx (no container needed)**

```bash
claude mcp add -e JIRA_URL="https://redhat.atlassian.net" -e JIRA_API_TOKEN="token" -e JIRA_USERNAME="user@redhat.com" --transport stdio jira -- uvx mcp-atlassian
```

#### Getting Tokens

For your Jira API token, use https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

### Notes and tips

- Do not commit real tokens. If you must keep a project-local file, prefer committing a `mcp.json.sample` with placeholders, and keep your real `mcp.json` untracked.
- Consider using the [rh-pre-commit](https://source.redhat.com/departments/it/it_information_security/leaktk/leaktk_components/rh_pre_commit) hook to scan for secrets accidentally left in commits.
- The `atlassian` server example uses an MCP container image: `ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest`.
- If you prefer Docker, replace the `podman` command with `docker` (arguments are typically the same).
- If Podman is installed via Podman Machine on macOS, ensure it is running: `podman machine start`.
- Limit active MCP servers: running too many at once can degrade performance or hit limits. Use Cursor's MCP panel to disable those you don't need for the current session.

## Installation

Ensure you have the ai-helpers marketplace enabled, via [the instructions here](/README.md).

```bash
# Install the plugin
/plugin install jira@ai-helpers
```

## Reference Files

This plugin uses shared reference files for progressive disclosure, following [Gemini CLI best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#progressive-disclosure-patterns).

Skills reference these files rather than duplicating content:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [reference/wiki-markup.md](reference/wiki-markup.md) | JIRA Wiki Markup formatting guide |
| [reference/mcp-tools.md](reference/mcp-tools.md) | MCP tool signatures and custom fields |
| [reference/cli-fallback.md](reference/cli-fallback.md) | jira-cli commands when MCP unavailable |

**Best Practice:** Keep references one level deep. Link directly from SKILL.md to reference files. Deeply nested references may result in partial file reads.

## Available Commands

### `/jira:solve` - Analyze and Solve JIRA Issues

Analyze a JIRA issue and create a pull request to solve it. The command fetches issue details, analyzes the codebase, creates an implementation plan, makes the necessary changes, and creates a PR with conventional commits.
