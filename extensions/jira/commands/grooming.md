## Name
jira:grooming

## Synopsis
```
/jira:grooming [project-filter] [time-period] [--component component-name] [--label label-name] [--type issue-type] [--status status] [--story-points]
```

## Description
The `jira:grooming` command helps teams prepare for backlog grooming meetings. It automatically collects bugs and user stories created within a specified time period OR assigned to a specific sprint, analyzes their priority, complexity, and dependencies, and generates structured grooming meeting agendas.

This command is particularly useful for:
- Backlog organization before sprint planning
- Sprint-specific grooming sessions
- Sprint-specific grooming sessions with story point summaries
- Sprint retrospectives analyzing completed work
- Regular requirement grooming meetings
- Priority assessment of new bugs
- Technical debt organization and planning

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection** – Collect and categorize issues within specified time periods or sprints by type (Bug, Story, Task, Epic), extract key information (priority, components, labels), and identify unassigned or incomplete issues.

- **Story Point Analysis** – When `--story-points` flag is used, extract and analyze story points for all issues, calculate totals by status, priority, and type, and provide velocity metrics for sprint retrospectives.

- **Status Filtering** – Filter issues by status (e.g., Closed, Done, In Progress, Open) using the `--status` flag to focus on specific workflow states for sprint reviews or retrospectives.

- **Intelligent Analysis** – Evaluate issue complexity based on historical data, identify related or duplicate issues, analyze business value and technical impact, and detect potential dependencies.

- **Agenda Generation** – Build a structured, actionable meeting outline organized by priority and type, with discussion points, decision recommendations, estimation references, and risk alerts.

## Implementation

The `jira:grooming` command runs in three main phases:

### 🧩 Phase 1: Data Collection
- Automatically queries JIRA for issues based on the provided time range or sprint name:
  - **Time range mode**: Filters issues by creation date within the specified period (e.g., `last-week`, `2024-01-01:2024-01-31`)
  - **Sprint mode**: Filters issues by JIRA Sprint without time constraints (e.g., `"OTA 277"`)
  - Sprint detection: If the time-period parameter doesn't match known time range formats, it's treated as a sprint name
- Supports complex JQL filters, including multi-project, component-based, label-based, issue-type and status filtering.
- Extracts key fields such as title, type, priority, component, reporter, story points and assignee.
- Detects related or duplicate issues to provide better context.

### 🧠 Phase 2: Analysis & Processing
- Groups collected issues by type and priority (e.g., Critical Bugs, High Priority Stories).
- When `--story-points` flag is used:
  - Calculates total story points by status (Closed, In Progress, Open, etc.)
  - Calculates story points by priority and type
  - Identifies issues missing story point estimates
  - Computes velocity metrics for sprint retrospectives
- Identifies incomplete or unclear issues that need clarification.
- Estimates complexity and effort based on similar historical data.
- Highlights risks, dependencies, and recommended next actions.

### 📋 Phase 3: Report Generation
- Automatically generates a **structured grooming meeting agenda** in Markdown format.
- Includes discussion points, decision checklists, and action items.
- When `--story-points` flag is used, includes:
  - Story point summary section with totals by status
  - Velocity metrics and completion percentages
  - Breakdown by priority and issue type
  - List of issues missing story point estimates
- Output can be copied directly into Confluence or shared with the team.

## Usage Examples

1. **Single project weekly review**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week
   ```

2. **Multiple OpenShift projects**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming "OCPSTRAT,OCPBUGS,HOSTEDCP" last-2-weeks
   ```

3. **Filter by component**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --component "Control Plane"
   ```

4. **Custom date range**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPBUGS 2024-10-01:2024-10-15
   ```

5. **Filter by label**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --label "technical-debt"
   ```

6. **Combine component and label filters**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --component "Control Plane" --label "performance"
   ```

7. **Query sprint issues with component filter**:
   ```bash
   /jira:grooming OCPBUGS "OTA 277" --component "Cluster Version Operator"
   ```

8. **Filter by issue type**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --type Bug
   ```

9. **Filter by multiple issue types**:
   ```
   /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --type "Bug,Epic"
   ```

10. **Combine all filters**:
    ```
    /jira:grooming OCPSTRAT last-week --component "Control Plane" --label "performance" --type Story
    ```

11. **Sprint retrospective with closed issues and story points**:
   ```bash
   /jira:grooming "CORENET" "Sprint 276" --status Closed --story-points
   ```

12. **Combine Label and status filters**:
    ```bash
    /jira:grooming OCPBUGS last-week --label "performance" --status "NEW"
