# Activity Analysis

This module analyzes the collected issue data to identify blockers, progress, risks, and achievements. It produces the `analysis` section of each `IssueActivityData` structure.

## Overview

Activity analysis follows this flow:

```
1. Filter data to date range
         │
         ▼
2. Analyze changelog for key events
         │
         ▼
3. Analyze comments for context
         │
         ▼
4. Aggregate descendant status
         │
         ▼
5. Determine overall health
         │
         ▼
6. Build analysis result
```

## Step 1: Filter Data to Date Range

Apply the configured date range to all data:

**Changelog filtering**:
```python
# Pseudocode
for entry in changelog.histories:
    entry_date = parse_date(entry.created)
    if start_date <= entry_date <= end_date:
        include entry in filtered_changelog
```

**Comment filtering**:
```python
for comment in comments:
    comment_date = parse_date(comment.created)
    if start_date <= comment_date <= end_date:
        include comment in filtered_comments
```

**Descendant filtering**:
```python
for descendant in descendants:
    descendant_date = parse_date(descendant.updated)
    descendant.updated_in_range = (start_date <= descendant_date <= end_date)
```

## Step 2: Analyze Changelog for Key Events

Parse the filtered changelog to identify significant events:

### Status Transitions

Extract all status changes:

```json
{
  "status_transitions": [
    {
      "from": "To Do",
      "to": "In Progress",
      "date": "2025-01-07T09:00:00Z",
      "author": "jdoe@example.com",
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1235"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Categorize transitions**:

| Category | Transitions | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Started | To Do → In Progress, Backlog → In Progress | Work began |
| Completed | In Progress → Done, In Progress → Closed, In Review → Done | Work finished |
| Blocked | Any → Blocked, Any status with "blocked" | Work stopped |
| Reopened | Done → In Progress, Closed → Reopened | Issue came back |
| Review | In Progress → In Review, In Progress → Code Review | Awaiting review |

### Assignee Changes

Track who is working on what:

```json
{
  "assignee_changes": [
    {
      "from": "user1@example.com",
      "to": "user2@example.com",
      "date": "2025-01-08T10:00:00Z",
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1235"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Priority/Severity Changes

Note escalations or de-escalations:

```json
{
  "priority_changes": [
    {
      "from": "Medium",
      "to": "High",
      "date": "2025-01-09T11:00:00Z",
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1235"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Analyze Comments for Context

Scan comment text for keywords and patterns that indicate status.

**Note**: The keyword lists below are not exhaustive. LLMs should use semantic understanding to identify blockers, risks, and progress even when exact keywords don't match. For example, "blocks", "needs", "requires" are semantically similar to the listed keywords and should be treated equivalently.

**Future improvement**: Consider extracting these keyword lists into a shared dictionary file for easier maintenance and consistency across skills.

### Blocker Detection

**Keywords** (case-insensitive):
- "blocked", "blocking", "blocker", "blocks"
- "waiting on", "waiting for", "depends on"
- "stuck", "stalled", "halted"
- "dependency", "dependent on"
- "can't proceed", "cannot proceed"
- "need", "needs", "require", "requires" (when followed by external resource)

**Pattern matching**:
```regex
blocked\s+(by|on|waiting)\s+(.+)
waiting\s+(on|for)\s+(.+)
depends?\s+on\s+(.+)
need[s]?\s+(access|approval|input|response)\s+(from|to)\s+(.+)
```

**Extract blocker details**:
```json
{
  "blockers": [
    {
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1235",
      "description": "Waiting on infrastructure team for Azure subscription",
      "source": "comment",
      "date": "2025-01-08T14:00:00Z",
      "author": "jdoe@example.com",
      "quote": "Need Azure subscription approved before proceeding - submitted ticket #12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Risk Detection

**Keywords** (case-insensitive):
- "risk", "risky", "at risk"
- "concern", "concerned", "concerning"
- "problem", "problematic"
- "issue" (when describing a problem, not Jira issue)
- "delay", "delayed", "slipping"
- "might not", "may not", "won't make"
- "deadline", "timeline" (in negative context)

**Pattern matching**:
```regex
(at\s+)?risk\s+(of|that)\s+(.+)
concern(ed)?\s+(about|that|with)\s+(.+)
might\s+not\s+(make|meet|finish|complete)\s+(.+)
delay(ed)?\s+(by|due to|because)\s+(.+)
```

**Extract risk details**:
```json
{
  "risks": [
    {
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1234",
      "description": "May slip deadline due to API changes in upstream",
      "source": "comment",
      "date": "2025-01-10T09:00:00Z",
      "author": "jsmith@example.com",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Completion/Achievement Detection

**Keywords** (case-insensitive):
- "completed", "complete", "done", "finished"
- "merged", "landed", "shipped"
- "delivered", "released", "deployed"
- "resolved", "fixed", "closed"
- "PR merged", "MR merged"

**Pattern matching**:
```regex
(PR|MR|pull request|merge request)\s*#?\d+\s+(merged|landed)
completed\s+(.+)
finished\s+(.+)
shipped\s+(.+)
```

**Extract achievement details**:
```json
{
  "achievements": [
    {
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1236",
      "description": "PR #456 merged adding OAuth2 token validation",
      "source": "comment",
      "date": "2025-01-09T16:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Progress Detection

**Keywords** (case-insensitive):
- "started", "starting", "began", "beginning"
- "working on", "implementing", "developing"
- "in progress", "underway", "ongoing"
- "reviewing", "in review", "under review"
- "testing", "in testing"
- "draft PR", "WIP"

**Extract progress details**:
```json
{
  "in_progress": [
    {
      "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1237",
      "description": "Session handling refactor, draft PR submitted",
      "source": "comment",
      "date": "2025-01-10T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Help Needed Detection

**Keywords**:
- "need help", "need assistance"
- "looking for", "seeking"
- "anyone know", "does anyone"
- "stuck on", "struggling with"

## Step 4: Aggregate Descendant Status

Calculate metrics across all descendants:

```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "total_descendants": 15,
    "by_status": {
      "Done": 8,
      "In Progress": 4,
      "To Do": 2,
      "Blocked": 1
    },
    "completed": 8,
    "in_progress": 4,
    "not_started": 2,
    "blocked": 1,
    "completion_percentage": 53,
    "updated_in_range": 6
  }
}
```

**Status categorization**:

| Category | Statuses |
|----------|----------|
| Completed | Done, Closed, Resolved, Release Pending, Verified, ON_QA |
| In Progress | In Progress, In Review, Code Review, Testing, In Development |
| Not Started | To Do, Backlog, Open, New |
| Blocked | Blocked, On Hold, Waiting |

**Completion percentage**:
```
completion_percentage = (completed / total_descendants) * 100
```

## Step 5: Determine Overall Health

Based on collected signals, determine the health status:

### Health: Green

**Indicators** (any of):
- Completion percentage increased since last period
- PRs merged or in active review
- Status transitions show forward progress
- No blockers identified
- No high-severity risks

**Thresholds**:
- Completion percentage > 50% OR increased by > 10%
- At least 1 achievement in date range
- Zero blockers
- Zero high-severity risks

### Health: Yellow

**Indicators** (any of):
- Slow progress (few status changes)
- Minor blockers that are being addressed
- Risks identified but manageable
- Some items stalled but majority progressing
- Waiting on external dependencies with clear timeline

**Thresholds**:
- Completion percentage between 25-50%
- 1-2 blockers with known resolution path
- Medium-severity risks only
- At least some activity in date range

### Health: Red

**Indicators** (any of):
- Significant blockers with no resolution path
- No progress in date range
- Multiple high-severity risks
- Critical dependencies unmet
- Deadline at risk

**Thresholds**:
- Completion percentage < 25% with no recent progress
- 3+ blockers OR any blocker without resolution
- High-severity risks
- No achievements in date range AND no active work

### Health Decision Logic

```python
def determine_health(analysis):
    # Red conditions (any triggers red)
    if analysis.blockers and any(b.unresolved for b in analysis.blockers):
        return "red"
    if len(analysis.blockers) >= 3:
        return "red"
    if any(r.severity == "high" for r in analysis.risks):
        return "red"
    if not analysis.achievements and not analysis.in_progress:
        return "red"

    # Green conditions (all must be true)
    if (analysis.achievements
        and not analysis.blockers
        and not any(r.severity in ["high", "medium"] for r in analysis.risks)):
        return "green"

    # Default to yellow
    return "yellow"
```

## Step 6: Build Analysis Result

Combine all analysis into the final structure:

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "health": "green",
    "health_reason": "Good progress with 2 PRs merged and no blockers",
    "blockers": [],
    "risks": [
      {
        "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1234",
        "description": "API deprecation in upstream may require refactor",
        "severity": "low"
      }
    ],
    "achievements": [
      "PR #456 merged adding OAuth2 token validation (OCPSTRAT-1235)",
      "AUTH-101 completed: token refresh mechanism (OCPSTRAT-1236)"
    ],
    "in_progress": [
      "Session handling refactor, draft PR in review (OCPSTRAT-1237)"
    ],
    "metrics": {
      "total_descendants": 15,
      "completed": 8,
      "in_progress": 4,
      "not_started": 2,
      "blocked": 1,
      "completion_percentage": 53,
      "updated_in_range": 6
    },
    "notable_transitions": [
      "OCPSTRAT-1235: To Do → Done",
      "OCPSTRAT-1236: In Progress → Done"
    ],
    "key_comments": [
      {
        "issue_key": "OCPSTRAT-1234",
        "author": "jdoe@example.com",
        "date": "2025-01-09",
        "quote": "PR #456 merged with all review feedback addressed"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Cross-Referencing

Enhance analysis by cross-referencing data:

### Comment ↔ Status Transition

When a comment mentions completion AND a status transition to Done exists within 24 hours:
- Link them together for richer context
- Use comment text to describe the achievement

### Blocker ↔ Descendant

When a blocker is mentioned AND a descendant is in Blocked status:
- Link them together
- Use descendant's status for validation

### PR Mention ↔ External Links

When a comment mentions "PR #123" AND external-links module finds that PR:
- Link them together
- Use PR metadata (merged date, state) to validate comment claims

## Priority Scoring

Score items by importance for summary generation:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Blocker mentioned | +10 |
| Risk mentioned | +7 |
| Completion mentioned | +5 |
| Status transition | +3 |
| PR/MR reference | +4 |
| Recent (last 2 days) | +2 |
| From assignee | +2 |
| Contains quote-worthy text | +3 |

Higher-scored items appear first in summaries.

## Bot Comment Detection

Filter out automated comments that don't provide human insight:

**Known bot patterns**:
- Author display name contains: "Automation", "Bot", "GitHub Actions", "Jenkins"
- Author email domain: `noreply@`, `automation@`
- Comment body patterns:
  - Starts with "Build triggered"
  - Contains "automatically generated"
  - Contains "This is an automated message"
  - Jira workflow transitions ("Status changed by workflow")

**Keep these "bot" comments** (they have useful info):
- GitHub/GitLab integration comments with PR links
- CI status updates with test results
