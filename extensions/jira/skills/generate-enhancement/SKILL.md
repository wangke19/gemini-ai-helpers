# Generate Enhancement from Jira Epic or Feature

This skill provides implementation guidance for generating OpenShift enhancement proposal markdown files based on Jira epic or feature issues.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is automatically invoked by the `/jira:generate-enhancement` command to guide the enhancement generation process from Jira epics or features.

## Prerequisites

- MCP Jira server configured and accessible (or direct API access)
- User has permissions to view the target epic or feature
- Epic or Feature issue exists and has substantive content
- Understanding of OpenShift enhancement process

**Reference Documentation:**
- [OpenShift Enhancement Template](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/guidelines/enhancement_template.md)
- [Enhancement Guidelines](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/tree/master/guidelines)
- [MCP Tools Reference](../../reference/mcp-tools.md)

## What is an OpenShift Enhancement?

An OpenShift enhancement proposal is:
- A **design document** that describes significant changes to OpenShift
- A **communication tool** for building consensus among stakeholders
- An **architectural record** for future reference
- A **mandatory process** for all enhancements (starting with release 4.3)

### Enhancement Template Structure

The enhancement proposal uses YAML frontmatter metadata and structured markdown sections:

```markdown
---
title: neat-enhancement-idea
authors:
  - "@github-username"
reviewers:
  - "@reviewer1"
  - "@reviewer2"
approvers:
  - "@approver"
api-approvers:
  - None  # Or "@api-approver" if API changes
creation-date: yyyy-mm-dd
last-updated: yyyy-mm-dd
status: provisional
tracking-link:
  - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/FEATURE-123

## Workflow: Generate Enhancement from Epic or Feature

### Step 1: Fetch Epic or Feature from Jira

Use direct API calls or MCP tools to retrieve the issue:

```bash
# Direct API (used in OCPSTRAT-1596 example)
curl -u "$USERNAME:$API_TOKEN" \
  "https://redhat.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/<ISSUE-KEY>"
```

**Extract key information:**
- Summary (becomes enhancement title)
- Description (contains problem statement, goals, acceptance criteria)
- Components (determines topology considerations)
- Target version (informs graduation criteria)
- Child issues (epics, stories, tasks - become implementation details)
- Creation date (metadata)
- Issue type (Epic or Feature)

**Validation checks:**
- ✅ Issue type is "Epic" or "Feature"
- ✅ Issue has description content
- ✅ Issue summary is meaningful
- ⚠️  Warn if missing: detailed description, acceptance criteria, child issues

### Step 2: Parse Epic or Feature Description

**For Features created via `/jira:create feature`:**

Features follow this structure:

```text
<Brief overview>

h2. Market Problem
<Problem description>

h2. Proposed Solution
<Solution description>

h2. Strategic Value
h3. Customer Value
* <benefits>

h3. Business Impact
* <impacts>

h2. Success Criteria
h3. Adoption
* <metrics>

h2. Scope
h3. Epics (Planned)
* Epic 1: <name>
* Epic 2: <name>

h3. Out of Scope
* <items>

h2. Timeline
* Target: <release>
* Milestones: <dates>
```

**Parse sections into variables:**
- `overview` - First paragraph
- `market_problem` - Content under "Market Problem"
- `solution` - Content under "Proposed Solution"
- `customer_value` - Items under "Customer Value"
- `success_criteria` - All success criteria sections
- `epics_planned` - Epic list
- `out_of_scope` - Out of scope items
- `timeline` - Timeline information

**For Epics:**

Epics typically have simpler structure (as seen in HIVE-2589, OCPSTRAT-1596):

```text
<Epic summary>

h3. Feature Overview (aka. Goal Summary)
<Brief description>

h3. Goals (aka. expected user outcomes)
<What should be achieved>

h3. Requirements (aka. Acceptance Criteria)
<What must be delivered>

[Deployment considerations table]

h3. Questions to Answer (Optional)
<Open questions>

h3. Background
<Context and motivation>

h3. Documentation Considerations
<Docs needed>

h3. Interoperability Considerations
<Integration points>
```

**Parse epic sections into variables:**
- `overview` - Feature Overview / Goal Summary
- `goals` - Goals section
- `acceptance_criteria` - Requirements / Acceptance Criteria
- `deployment_considerations` - Table of deployment scenarios
- `background` - Background section (use as motivation)
- `questions` - Open questions
- `docs_considerations` - Documentation needs
- `interop_considerations` - Interoperability needs

**For both types, also fetch child issues:**
```bash
# Get child stories/tasks/epics
curl -u "$USERNAME:$API_TOKEN" \
  "https://redhat.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search" \
  --data-urlencode "jql=parent = <ISSUE-KEY>"
```

### Step 3: Generate Enhancement Metadata

```yaml
---
title: <generated-from-summary>
authors:
  - "@<jira-reporter-github-username>"  # Prompt if unknown
reviewers:
  - TBD  # Prompt for reviewers
approvers:
  - TBD  # Prompt for approver (typically team lead)
api-approvers:
  - None  # Or prompt if API changes detected
creation-date: <feature-creation-date>
last-updated: <current-date>
status: provisional
tracking-link:
  - <jira-feature-url>
see-also:
  - # Related enhancements (optional)
replaces:
  - # If replacing existing enhancement (optional)
superseded-by:
  - # Leave empty
---
```

**Title generation:**
- Convert summary to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters
- Example: "Advanced HCP Observability" → "advanced-hcp-observability"

**Detect API changes:**
- Search description for: "API", "CRD", "Custom Resource", "field", "endpoint"
- If detected, prompt: "This feature mentions API changes. Who should review API changes?"

### Step 4: Map Content to Enhancement Sections

#### Summary
Use the feature overview (first paragraph) as the enhancement summary.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Summary

Deliver unified observability capabilities for ROSA and ARO hosted control planes,
enabling enterprise customers to manage large cluster fleets with centralized
monitoring, alerting, and compliance reporting.
```

#### Motivation
Map from the **Market Problem** section:

```markdown
## Motivation

<Content from "Market Problem" section>

This addresses the critical need for <summarize problem impact>.
```

#### User Stories
Two approaches:

**Approach 1: Extract from feature if present**
Some features include user stories in the description.

**Approach 2: Generate from customer value**
Convert customer value bullet points into user story format:

```markdown
### User Stories

#### Story 1: Fleet-wide Visibility
As a platform administrator managing 50+ ROSA HCP clusters, I want to view
aggregated health metrics across all clusters in a single dashboard, so that
I can quickly identify issues without navigating between separate UIs.

#### Story 2: Faster Incident Response
As an SRE, I want to receive alerts based on cross-cluster conditions, so that
I can detect and respond to incidents 80% faster than with per-cluster monitoring.
```

**Prompt if needed:**
```text
The feature doesn't include explicit user stories. I can:
1. Generate user stories from the customer value section
2. Prompt you to provide user stories

Which would you prefer?
```

#### Goals
Map from **Strategic Value** and **Proposed Solution**:

```markdown
### Goals

* Deliver centralized metrics aggregation across all customer clusters
* Provide unified dashboards for cluster health, performance, and capacity
* Enable fleet-wide alerting with intelligent cross-cluster correlation
* Support compliance and audit reporting across cluster fleet
* <Additional goals from strategic value>
```

#### Non-Goals
Map from **Out of Scope** section:

```markdown
### Non-Goals

* Log aggregation (separate feature planned for 2026)
* AI-powered predictive analytics (follow-on feature)
* Support for standalone OpenShift clusters (not HCP)
* Cost optimization recommendations (different feature)
```

If not present, prompt:
```text
What is explicitly OUT of scope for this enhancement?

This helps prevent scope creep and sets clear boundaries.
```

#### Proposal - Workflow Description
Generate from **Proposed Solution**:

```markdown
### Workflow Description

**Platform Administrator:**
1. Accesses unified observability dashboard
2. Views aggregated metrics across all managed clusters
3. Configures fleet-wide alert rules
4. Generates compliance reports for audit purposes

**SRE:**
1. Receives cross-cluster alert notification
2. Uses dashboard to identify affected clusters
3. Drills down into specific cluster metrics
4. Takes remediation action with API/CLI
```

Prompt if details missing:
```text
Please describe the typical workflow for using this feature:
- What does the user do first?
- What are the key interactions?
- What is the end result?
```

#### Proposal - API Extensions
Prompt for API changes:

```text
Does this feature introduce or modify APIs? (yes/no)

If yes, describe:
- New CRDs or API resources
- New fields in existing resources
- API endpoints
- Validation webhooks
```

**If no API changes:**
```markdown
### API Extensions

This enhancement does not introduce new API extensions.
```

**If API changes:**
````markdown
### API Extensions

#### New CRD: ObservabilityConfiguration

```yaml
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObservabilityConfiguration
metadata:
  name: fleet-config
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      fleet: production
  metricsRetention: 30d
  alertRules:
    - name: high-cpu
      expression: "avg(cpu_usage) > 80"
```

<Additional API details>
````

#### Proposal - Topology Considerations
Auto-detect from feature components and prompt:

```python
# Detect from components
hypershift_detected = "HyperShift" in components or "ROSA" in components or "ARO" in components
standalone_detected = "Standalone" in description or not hypershift_detected
```

**For each topology, generate section:**

```markdown
#### Hypershift / Hosted Control Planes

This enhancement is designed specifically for Hypershift hosted control planes
(ROSA HCP and ARO HCP). It provides fleet-level observability by aggregating
metrics from control planes running in the management cluster.

**Considerations:**
* Metrics are collected from hosted control plane namespaces
* Aggregation service runs in the management cluster
* Supports multi-tenant isolation of metrics data
```

**Prompt if unclear:**
```text
Which OpenShift topologies does this enhancement support?

1. Hypershift / Hosted Control Planes (ROSA HCP, ARO HCP)
2. Standalone Clusters
3. Single-node Deployments or MicroShift
4. OpenShift Kubernetes Engine (OKE)

Select all that apply (comma-separated): 1,2
```

#### Proposal - Implementation Details
Map from **Epics (Planned)** section:

```markdown
### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

This enhancement will be delivered through the following epics:

1. **Multi-cluster metrics aggregation infrastructure** ([EPIC-1])
   - Build centralized metrics collection service
   - Implement storage backend for aggregated metrics
   - Establish secure communication from clusters to aggregator

2. **Unified observability dashboard and visualization** ([EPIC-2])
   - Develop dashboard UI components
   - Integrate with metrics aggregation API
   - Support customizable views and filters

3. **Fleet-wide alerting and intelligent correlation** ([EPIC-3])

```

**Fetch linked epics if available:**
```python
# Get linked epics from feature
epics = mcp__atlassian__jira_search_issues(
    jql=f'parent = {feature_key} AND type = Epic'
)

# Include epic summaries and keys in implementation details
```

#### Risks and Mitigations
Map from **Risks and Mitigation** section in feature (if present), or prompt:

```markdown

```

### Step 5: Prompt for Missing Sections

Some sections cannot be derived from the feature and require prompts:

**Drawbacks:**
```text
What are the drawbacks or downsides of this approach?

Consider:
- Added complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Performance impact
- Operational overhead
```

**Alternatives:**
```text
What alternative approaches were considered but not implemented?

For each alternative:

```

### Step 6: Generate Filename and Write File

**Filename generation:**
```python
def generate_filename(summary: str, component: str = None) -> str:
    # Convert summary to kebab-case
    filename = summary.lower()
    filename = filename.replace(" ", "-")
    filename = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9-]', '', filename)

    # Add .md extension
    return f"{filename}.md"

# Examples:
# "Advanced HCP Observability" → "advanced-hcp-observability.md"
# "Multi-cluster Metrics" → "multi-cluster-metrics.md"
```

**Directory selection:**
Suggest directory based on component:

| Component | Directory |
|-----------|-----------|
| HyperShift, ROSA, ARO | `enhancements/hypershift/` |
| Networking | `enhancements/network/` |
| Storage | `enhancements/storage/` |
| Authentication | `enhancements/authentication/` |
| Other | `enhancements/` (root) |

Prompt:
```text
Suggested directory: enhancements/hypershift/
Suggested filename: advanced-hcp-observability.md

Accept? (yes/no/edit)
```

**Write file:**
```python
# Create directory if needed
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Write enhancement file
with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
    f.write(enhancement_content)
```

### Step 7: Report Results

```text
Created enhancement proposal:
  File: .work/enhancements/hypershift/advanced-hcp-observability.md
  Tracking: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNTRLPLANE-100

Next steps:
1. Review and refine technical details
2. Add reviewers and approvers to metadata
3. Complete any sections marked [TODO]
4. Share with stakeholders for feedback
5. Submit PR to openshift/enhancements repository

Sections requiring attention:
- [ ] Test Plan - Add specific test scenarios
- [ ] Support Procedures - Define diagnostic steps
- [ ] Operational Aspects - Add SLI details
```

### Step 8: Verify and Sync with PRs (Optional)

When `--verify` or `--sync-from-prs` flags are provided, analyze linked PRs to compare or update the enhancement.

#### Fetch Linked PRs

Discover PRs from multiple sources:

```python
def fetch_linked_prs(issue_key, repos=None):
    """Fetch all PRs linked to an epic/feature."""

    if repos is None:
        repos = [
            'openshift/api',
            'openshift/installer',
            'openshift/machine-api-operator',
            'openshift/cluster-api-provider-aws',
            'openshift/hive'
        ]

    all_prs = []

    # 1. From Jira issue links (issuelinks field)
    issue = fetch_issue(issue_key)
    for link in issue.get('fields', {}).get('issuelinks', []):
        if 'github.com' in str(link) and '/pull/' in str(link):
            all_prs.append(extract_pr_info(link))

    # 2. From Jira comments (GitHub bot comments)
    for comment in issue.get('fields', {}).get('comment', {}).get('comments', []):
        pr_links = extract_github_pr_links(comment['body'])
        all_prs.extend(pr_links)

    # 3. From child issues (stories, tasks, sub-epics)
    child_issues = fetch_child_issues(issue_key)
    for child in child_issues:
        child_prs = fetch_linked_prs(child['key'], repos)
        all_prs.extend(child_prs)

    # 4. Search GitHub for PRs mentioning the issue key
    for repo in repos:
        search_query = f'repo:{repo} "{issue_key}" in:body type:pr'
        github_prs = search_github(search_query)
        all_prs.extend(github_prs)

    # Deduplicate by PR URL
    return deduplicate_prs(all_prs)

def extract_pr_info(pr_url):
    """Fetch PR details from GitHub API."""
    # Extract org, repo, pr_number from URL
    # https://github.com/openshift/api/pull/1234
    match = re.match(r'https://github.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/(\d+)', pr_url)
    if not match:
        return None

    org, repo, pr_number = match.groups()

    # Fetch PR via GitHub API
    pr_data = github_api_get(f'/repos/{org}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}')

    return {
        'url': pr_url,
        'number': int(pr_number),
        'repo': f'{org}/{repo}',
        'title': pr_data['title'],

        'state': pr_data['state'],
        'merged': pr_data.get('merged', False),
        'files': fetch_pr_files(org, repo, pr_number),
        'commits': fetch_pr_commits(org, repo, pr_number)
    }
```

#### Verification Mode (`--verify`)

Compare enhancement sections against actual PR implementation:

```python

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Matches: 2
⚠️ Deviations: 2 (approach changed, standalone deferred)
❌ Incomplete: 1 (test coverage)

Recommendation: UPDATE ENHANCEMENT
The enhancement should be updated to reflect the CAPI-only approach
and document that standalone support is deferred to 4.23.

Run: /jira:generate-enhancement OCPSTRAT-1596 --sync-from-prs
```

#### Manual Edit Protection

Users can mark sections to prevent sync from overwriting:

**Comment-based:**
```markdown
## Motivation

<!-- MANUAL: Strategic rationale - do not sync -->

Enterprise customers deploying ROSA...
[manually written content]
```

**Frontmatter-based:**
```yaml
---
title: ec2-dedicated-hosts-on-aws
sync-exclude:
  - Motivation
  - User Stories
  - Drawbacks
---
```

The sync process will skip these sections and report:

```text
Preserved manual sections:
  - Motivation (marked <!-- MANUAL -->)
  - User Stories (in sync-exclude)
```

## Content Mapping Reference

### Jira Feature → Enhancement Mapping

| Jira Section | Enhancement Section | Transformation |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Summary | Title (metadata) | Convert to kebab-case |
| Overview | Summary | Direct copy |
| Market Problem | Motivation | Direct copy + context |
| Customer Value | User Stories | Convert to "As a... I want... So that..." |
| Strategic Value | Goals | Extract objectives |
| Out of Scope | Non-Goals | Direct copy |
| Proposed Solution | Workflow Description | Expand into step-by-step |
| Epics (Planned) | Implementation Details | List epics with details |
| Success Criteria | Graduation Criteria | Map adoption/outcomes to GA criteria |
| Timeline | Graduation Criteria | Map milestones to Dev Preview/Tech Preview/GA |
| Risks | Risks and Mitigations | Direct copy + expand |

## Enhancement Template Placeholders

For sections that cannot be derived from the feature, use informative placeholders:

```markdown
## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

**TODO:** Describe alternative approaches that were considered but not selected.

For each alternative:
- Brief description of the approach
- Pros and cons compared to the chosen solution
- Why it was rejected

Example alternatives to consider:
- Different architectural patterns
- Alternative technologies or frameworks
- Simpler approaches that were insufficient
```

## Validation Checks

Before writing the file, validate:

**Required sections present:**
- ✅ Summary (from epic/feature overview)
- ✅ Motivation (from background or market problem)
- ✅ Goals (from goals section or strategic value)
- ✅ Proposal (from child issues or solution)
- ⚠️  User Stories (generated or prompted)
- ⚠️  Test Plan (prompted)
- ⚠️  Graduation Criteria (from acceptance criteria or success criteria)

**Metadata complete:**
- ✅ Title generated
- ✅ Creation date from epic/feature
- ✅ Tracking link to epic/feature
- ⚠️  Authors (prompt if needed)
- ⚠️  Reviewers (prompt)
- ⚠️  Approvers (prompt)

**Quality checks:**
- ✅ No [TODO] markers without explanation
- ✅ No Jira wiki markup (h2., *, etc.) in final markdown
- ✅ All internal links valid
- ✅ Consistent terminology

## Jira Wiki Markup Conversion

Epics and features often use Jira wiki markup which must be converted to standard markdown:

| Jira Wiki | Markdown |
|-----------|----------|
| `h2. Heading` | `## Heading` |
| `h3. Heading` | `### Heading` |
| `* bullet` | `* bullet` (same) |
| `# numbered` | `1. numbered` |
| `[PROJ-123]` | `[PROJ-123](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJ-123)` |
| `{{code}}` | `` `code` `` |

```python
def convert_jira_to_markdown(jira_text: str) -> str:
    # Convert headings
    text = re.sub(r'^h2\.\s+(.+)$', r'## \1', jira_text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    text = re.sub(r'^h3\.\s+(.+)$', r'### \1', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)

    # Convert Jira links
    text = re.sub(r'\[([A-Z]+-\d+)\]',
                  r'[\1](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/\1)', text)

    # Convert inline code
    text = re.sub(r'{{(.+?)}}', r'`\1`', text)

    return text
```

## Error Handling

### Wrong Issue Type

**Scenario:** Issue is not type "Epic" or "Feature"

**Action:**
```text
CNTRLPLANE-123 is a Story, not an Epic or Feature.

This command requires an Epic or Feature issue type.

To create an enhancement from a Story, consider:
1. Convert the Story to an Epic or Feature first
2. Manually create the enhancement using the template
```

### Empty Description

**Scenario:** Epic or Feature has no description or minimal content

**Action:**
```text
Issue CNTRLPLANE-100 has minimal content.

Enhancement proposals require substantial detail. Please:
1. Complete the epic/feature description in Jira
2. Run /jira:generate-enhancement again

Or continue with interactive prompts to fill in details? (yes/no)
```

### Cannot Determine Component

**Scenario:** Cannot auto-detect component/directory from epic/feature

**Action:**
```text
Cannot determine the appropriate directory for this enhancement.

Please select:
1. enhancements/ (root - for broad-impact enhancements)
2. enhancements/hypershift/ (HyperShift/ROSA/ARO)
3. enhancements/network/ (Networking)
4. enhancements/storage/ (Storage)
5. enhancements/authentication/ (Auth/Identity)
6. Other (specify)

Selection:
```

## Best Practices

1. **Complete epic/feature first**: Ensure Jira epic or feature has comprehensive content before generation
2. **Review AI-generated content**: Enhancement is a starting point, not final document
3. **Add technical depth**: Expand implementation details with architecture diagrams, API specs
4. **Iterate with reviewers**: Share draft early for feedback
5. **Keep Jira updated**: Update epic/feature as enhancement evolves, or regenerate enhancement from updated Jira content
6. **Link bidirectionally**: Add enhancement PR link to epic/feature, epic/feature link in enhancement metadata
