## When to Use This Skill

This skill is automatically invoked when:
- Summary or description contains GCP HCP keywords: "GCP HCP", "Hypershift on GKE", "GKE hosted control plane"
- Project key is "GCP"
- User explicitly requests GCP HCP conventions

## Project Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project Key** | GCP |
| **Project Name** | GCP Hosted Control Planes (Hypershift on GKE) |
| **Issue Types** | Story, Epic, Task, Bug, Feature Request |

## Custom Fields

GCP project uses the same instance-wide custom fields as other Red Hat Jira projects:

| Field | Custom Field ID | Usage | Example |
|-------|-----------------|-------|---------|
| **Epic Name** | `customfield_10011` | Required when creating Epics | `"Multi-cluster metrics aggregation"` |
| **Epic Link** | `customfield_10014` | Link Story/Task → Epic | `"GCP-456"` |
| **Parent Link** | `customfield_10018` | Link Epic → Feature | `"GCP-100"` |
| **Story Points** | `customfield_10028` | Optional story point estimate | `3.0` |
| **Blocked** | `customfield_10517` | Mark issue as blocked (dropdown) | `{"value": "True"}` |

## Components

The GCP project uses these components for organizing work:

| Component | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `hypershift-operator-gcp` | HyperShift operator, control plane components |
| `gcp-hcp-automation` | Terraform, ArgoCD, infrastructure automation |
| `gcp-api-gateway` | API gateway work |
| `Retrospective action items` | Team retrospective tracking |

**Usage:**
- Components are **optional** - only specify if the work clearly fits a component
- Use the direct `components` parameter (NOT in `additional_fields`)
- If work doesn't fit any existing component, leave empty - do not request new components

## MCP Tool Integration

### For GCP HCP Stories in GCP Project

```python
mcp__atlassian__jira_create_issue(
    project_key="GCP",
    summary="<story summary>",
    issue_type="Story",
    description="<formatted story description>",
    components="<component name>",  # Optional - see Components section
    additional_fields={
        "customfield_10014": "GCP-456",  # Epic Link - parent epic
        "customfield_10028": 3.0,        # Story Points - auto-estimated per Sizing Guide
        "priority": {"name": "Major"},      # Priority - OMIT unless user specifies
        "labels": ["ai-generated-jira"],
        "security": {"name": "Red Hat Employee"}
    }
)
```

**Story Points guidance**: When creating a Story or Task, auto-estimate story points by analyzing the issue summary, description, and acceptance criteria against the [Story Sizing Guide](#story-sizing-guide). Set `customfield_10028` as a float (e.g. `3.0`). Use the Fibonacci scale: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. For estimates of 8 or higher, add a note in the description recommending the story be split into smaller items. The `ai-generated-jira` label (already applied) serves as an indicator that points were AI-estimated; the team reviews and adjusts estimates during refinement.

**Priority guidance**: Before creating an issue, ask the user if they want to set a specific priority: "Would you like to set a priority for this issue? The default is Normal." Reference the [Priority Scheme (OJA-PRIS-001)](#priority-scheme-oja-pris-001) below to guide the conversation. If yes, set `priority` as an object with `name` field (e.g. `{"name": "Major"}`). If no, omit the field to use the default.

### For GCP HCP Epics in GCP Project

```python
mcp__atlassian__jira_create_issue(
    project_key="GCP",
    summary="<epic summary>",
    issue_type="Epic",
    description="<formatted epic description>",
    components="<component name>",  # Optional - see Components section
    additional_fields={
        "customfield_10011": "Multi-cluster metrics aggregation",  # Epic Name (required, same as summary)
        "labels": ["ai-generated-jira"],
        "security": {"name": "Red Hat Employee"}
    }
    # NOTE: Do NOT include parent link (customfield_10018) here.
    # Add parent link in a separate update call per "Epic Linking Best Practices" section.
)
```

## Epic Linking Best Practices

**When creating an Epic with a parent Feature:**

1. Create Epic first WITHOUT parent link
2. Link to Feature in a separate update call

**Example:**
```python
# Step 1: Create Epic
epic = mcp__atlassian__jira_create_issue(
    project_key="GCP",
    issue_type="Epic",
    summary="Multi-cluster monitoring",
    additional_fields={
        "customfield_10011": "Multi-cluster monitoring",  # Epic Name
        "labels": ["ai-generated-jira"],
        "security": {"name": "Red Hat Employee"}
    }
)

# Step 2: Link to Feature
mcp__atlassian__jira_update_issue(
    issue_key=epic["key"],
    fields={},
    additional_fields={
        "customfield_10018": "GCP-100"  # Parent Link (Feature key)
    }
)
```

## GCP HCP Team Standards

The GCP HCP team maintains standardized templates and definitions to ensure consistent, high-quality JIRA tickets. **All GCP project issues MUST conform to these standards.**

### JIRA Templates

When creating GCP project issues, follow the appropriate template structure below. The full template content is embedded here for reference; source URLs are provided for each template.

---

### Story Template

Source: [jira-story-template.md](https://github.com/openshift-online/gcp-hcp/blob/main/docs/jira-story-template.md)

Required structure for all Stories:

#### User Story

**As a** [platform user/developer/operations team/end user]
**I want** [goal/desire],
**so that** [benefit/reason].

_[Optional placeholder for another user story if this deliverable serves multiple users]_

#### Context / Background

[Current state, problem being solved, relevant history, links to related tickets/incidents]

#### Requirements

[Functional and non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, reliability, SLOs, compliance)]

#### Technical Approach

[Proposed solution, technologies/tools, major steps, alternatives considered]

#### Dependencies

[Blocking items: other teams/stories, external vendors, infrastructure/access needs, required approvals]

#### Additional Context

[Any relevant background, links, screenshots, or technical notes]

#### Story Sizing Guide

Use this guide to estimate the size of a story during refinement. Story sizes reflect complexity, risk, and effort combined. Story points use the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to reflect increasing uncertainty as size grows. Stories should typically be **1-5 points**. Stories sized at 8+ should be split into smaller stories.

##### Pointing Criteria

| Points | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **0** | Rarely used. Trivial task with stakeholder value but less risk/complexity than a 1-pointer. Example: Update a README link. |
| **1** | The smallest issue possible, everything scales from here. Can be a one-line change in code, a tedious but extremely simple task, etc. Basically, no risk, very low effort, very low complexity. |
| **2** | Simple, well-understood change. Low risk, low complexity but slightly more effort than a 1. Some investigation into how to accomplish the task may be necessary. |
| **3** | Doesn't have to be complex, but it is usually time consuming. The work should be fairly straightforward. There can be some minor risks. |
| **5** | Requires investigation, design, discussions, collaboration. Can be time consuming or complex. Risks involved. |
| **8** | Big task. Requires investigation, design, discussions, collaboration. Solution is challenging. Risks expected. Design doc required. **Consider splitting into smaller stories.** |
| **13** | Ideally, this shouldn't be used. If you ever see an issue that is this big, **it must be split into smaller stories**. |

##### Story Point Examples (GCP HCP Context)

**1 Point Examples**:
- Add a new environment variable to an existing operator deployment
- Update GKE node pool version in terraform config
- Fix a typo in HyperShift API field documentation
- Add a simple validation check to an existing function

**2 Point Examples**:
- Implement a new Prometheus metric for hosted control plane CPU usage
- Add retry logic to GCP API client with exponential backoff
- Create a simple e2e test for GKE cluster creation
- Update RBAC rules to allow service account access to a new resource type

**3 Point Examples**:
- Implement health checks for all management cluster components
- Add automated cleanup of orphaned GCP resources after cluster deletion
- Refactor logging configuration to use structured logging library
- Implement GCP service account impersonation for a specific workload

**5 Point Examples**:
- Design and implement a new controller to manage GCP firewall rules for hosted clusters
- Add support for customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to a storage component
- Implement automated backup and restore for management cluster state
- Migrate an existing operator from in-cluster to out-of-cluster deployment pattern

**8 Point Examples** (Should be split):
- Implement full observability stack (metrics, logging, tracing) for hosted control planes
- Add support for VPC-native GKE clusters with IP aliasing and network policies
- Migrate entire CI/CD pipeline from one platform to another

##### When to Split Stories

Split a story if any of these apply:

**By scope**:
- More than 5 acceptance criteria
- Touches more than 3 components or repositories
- Contains both investigation (spike) AND implementation work
- Has internal sequencing (step 1 must complete before step 2 begins)

**By layer**:
- API changes + controller implementation + CLI updates → 3 stories
- Backend logic + frontend UI + documentation → 3 stories

**By workflow step**:
- Create + Read + Update + Delete operations → 4 stories (or start with Create + Read)

**By component**:
- Changes needed in multiple operators → 1 story per operator
- Changes needed across multiple GCP services → 1 story per service

**By risk**:
- Separate proof-of-concept spike from production implementation
- Separate migration work (risky) from new feature work (lower risk)

##### Splitting Strategies

When splitting a large story, consider these approaches:

1. **Vertical slices**: Each story delivers end-to-end value for a subset of functionality
   - "As a user, I can create a cluster with default settings" → Story 1
   - "As a user, I can create a cluster with custom network settings" → Story 2

2. **Technical layers**: Split by component or layer (use sparingly, prefer vertical slices)
   - API design and implementation → Story 1
   - Controller implementation → Story 2
   - CLI integration → Story 3

3. **Spike + Implementation**: Separate research from execution
   - "Investigate options for GCP Workload Identity Federation" → Spike
   - "Implement WIF for HyperShift operator" → Story

4. **Incremental delivery**: Build complexity over multiple stories
   - "Implement basic health check endpoint" → Story 1
   - "Add detailed health metrics to endpoint" → Story 2
   - "Add automated alerting based on health metrics" → Story 3

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Specific testable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific testable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific testable outcome 3]

### Definition of Done

Source: [definition-of-done.md](https://github.com/openshift-online/gcp-hcp/blob/main/docs/definition-of-done.md)

When generating issue descriptions for GCP project, ensure acceptance criteria align with the relevant Definition of Done below.

#### Story DoD

1. Story satisfies all acceptance criteria
2. Test automation complete, where applicable:
   1. Unit test coverage at >= 85% and passing
   2. Integration tests added and passing
   3. e2e test added and passing
3. PR for code changes has been merged
4. AI-Assisted Development: Human-in-the-Loop Guidelines are followed (e.g. commit message conventions)
5. PR for relevant architecture and design doc changes has been merged
6. Deployment to stage (once we have a stage platform)
7. Story is demo-able for end of sprint

#### Spike DoD

1. Spike findings are documented
2. Decision is made and documented in the relevant design decision/architecture docs
3. Resulting backlog items are created

#### Bug DoD

1. Test Added
   - Automated test included that verifies the fix
   - If not feasible, document why in the PR
2. Root Cause Documented
   - PR description explains what caused the bug
3. All Tests Pass
   - New and existing tests pass
   - No regressions introduced
4. Code Review Approved
   - At least one approval received
5. Ticket Closed
   - Link to merged PR added to bug ticket

### Priority Scheme (OJA-PRIS-001)

Apply Priority according to priority scheme OJA-PRIS-001 ([documented here](https://spaces.redhat.com/spaces/HUB/pages/686720015/OJA+Jira+Configuration+Taxonomy)):

- **Blocker** = To be worked above all other priorities. Select Blocker when the severity of the issue is very high, has no workaround, or the effort for the change is comparatively low. Issues that may be very publicly visible and could generate significant media attention may also drive a higher priority.
- **Critical** = Must do. To be worked immediately following BLOCKER issues.
- **Major** = Should do. To be worked after higher priority (blocker and critical) issues are resolved. Select Major when the severity is high and the effort to change it is low to moderate. Issues in this category likely have an existing workaround but implementation or execution may be non-trivial.
- **Normal** = Could do/nice to have. To be worked after higher priority (blocker, critical and major) issues are resolved. Select Normal when the severity of an issue is relatively close to the level of effort to fix it. The existence of an easily implemented workaround can also lead to this priority level instead of a higher priority.
- **Minor** = Won't do. To be worked after blocker, critical, major, and normal priorities are resolved. Select Minor when the severity of the issue is low, or the complexity or effort to correct it may be higher, relatively speaking. For minor priority issues, known workarounds exist or are not needed due to the trivial effort needed to address the issue.
- **Undefined** = The priority has not been specified or not yet evaluated by the team.
