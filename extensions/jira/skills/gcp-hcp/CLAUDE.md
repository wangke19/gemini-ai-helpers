## Sync Instructions

When this skill needs updating (upstream templates changed, new sections added):

1. Fetch the latest content from each upstream file:
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-online/gcp-hcp/main/docs/jira-story-template.md
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-online/gcp-hcp/main/docs/jira-epic-template.md
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-online/gcp-hcp/main/docs/jira-feature-template.md
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-online/gcp-hcp/main/docs/definition-of-done.md
2. Compare against the embedded content in SKILL.md
3. Update SKILL.md with any new or changed content
4. Run `make lint` from the `ai-helpers` repo root to validate

## Notes on Sources

**Priority Scheme (OJA-PRIS-001):**
- This content is **not** from upstream openshift-online/gcp-hcp
- Source: Red Hat internal priority scheme OJA-PRIS-001
- This is team-agnostic guidance maintained directly in ai-helpers
- Keep this section synchronized with other Jira skills that reference OJA-PRIS-001

## Notes on Intentional Omissions

The following upstream content was intentionally excluded from SKILL.md and should not be re-introduced during sync:

- **Feature Template worked example** (`jira-feature-template.md` "Example Feature" section): Omitted to keep SKILL.md focused on template structure rather than filled-in examples.
- **Epic Template worked example** (`jira-epic-template.md` "Example Epic" section): Omitted to keep SKILL.md focused on template structure rather than filled-in examples.

All upstream URLs reference the `main` branch. If the canonical branch changes, update the URLs above accordingly.
