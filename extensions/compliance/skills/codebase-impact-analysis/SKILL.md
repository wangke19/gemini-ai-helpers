# Codebase Impact Analysis

Determines whether a Go codebase is impacted by a specific CVE by applying multiple analysis methods with increasing confidence, collecting evidence, and assigning a risk level.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- A CVE profile has been gathered (from the cve-intelligence-gathering skill)
- You need to determine if the current Go project is affected
- You need to assign a risk level with supporting evidence

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools (validated in Phase 0 of parent command)
- `go` toolchain with `go.mod` in workspace root
- `govulncheck`: `go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest`
- `callgraph`: `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/callgraph@latest`
- `digraph`: `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/digraph@latest`

### Required Inputs

**From Phase 1 (CVE Intelligence Gathering skill):**
- CVE ID
- Affected package/module name(s)
- Vulnerable version range
- Fixed version (if available)
- Vulnerable function signatures (if known)

**From Parent Command:**
- `--algo` preference for call graph analysis (default: `vta`)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Identify Go Module Dependencies

```bash
# Parse dependencies from go.mod
go list -m all

# Get detailed dependency info
go list -m -json all
```

- Read `go.mod` from workspace root
- Parse direct and indirect dependencies
- Extract module versions

### Step 2: Cross-Reference Vulnerable Packages

Apply the following methods in order. Each provides increasing confidence.

#### Method 1: Dependency Matching

- Compare CVE-affected packages with `go.mod` dependencies
- Check if affected package versions are in use
- Account for version ranges and semantic versioning

```bash
# Check if vulnerable package is a dependency
go list -m <vulnerable-package>
```

**Decision Point:**
- IF package NOT in dependencies → Skip to risk assignment (likely LOW RISK)
- IF package found → Continue to Method 2

#### Method 2: Go Vulnerability Scanner

```bash
# Run official Go vulnerability scanner
govulncheck ./...
```

- Parse output for CVE matches
- Check if vulnerable symbols are reported as called

**Decision Point:**
- IF govulncheck confirms vulnerability → Strong evidence for HIGH RISK
- IF govulncheck does not find it → Continue to Method 3 (CVE may not be in Go vulndb yet)

#### Method 3: Direct Dependency Check

```bash
# Verify package is included (directly or transitively)
go list -mod=mod <vulnerable-package>
```

**Note:** Package presence alone doesn't prove vulnerable functions are called.

#### Method 4: Source Code Analysis

- Search for import statements of vulnerable packages in source code
- Use grep/codebase_search to find package usage
- Search for vulnerable function/method names in codebase
- Identify actual code paths that use vulnerable functions
- Check if vulnerable functions are called in reachable code

#### Method 5: Call Graph Reachability Analysis (Highest Confidence)

Delegate to the [call-graph-analysis](../call-graph-analysis/SKILL.md) skill.

- **Pass**: `--algo` preference from user, vulnerable function signature, package path
- **Receive**: Risk level, call chain, evidence files
- **Only run if**: Codebase compiles successfully and highest confidence assessment is needed

#### Method 6: Configuration and Context Analysis

- Review if vulnerable features are actually enabled
- Check if vulnerable code paths are behind feature flags
- Verify if inputs can reach vulnerable functions
- Consider security controls (input validation, sandboxing)

### Confidence Levels

Each method provides increasing confidence:

1. **Basic Presence** (Low) — Package in `go.mod` (Method 1, 3)
2. **Import & Version Analysis** (Medium) — Package imported, version in vulnerable range, function names found (Method 4)
3. **Vulnerability Scanner** (Medium-High) — `govulncheck` confirms reachable vulnerable symbols (Method 2)
4. **Call Graph Reachability** (Highest) — Proven execution path from entry point to vulnerable function (Method 5)
5. **Context Analysis** — Mitigating or aggravating factors (Method 6)

Use multiple methods. Confidence determination should be data-driven, not formula-based.

### Step 3: Build Evidence Package

Collect evidence from all methods used:

- **Dependency Evidence**: `go.mod` entries, `go list` output, version info
- **Static Code Evidence**: File paths, line numbers, code snippets showing usage
- **Reachability Evidence**: Call graph output, execution paths, DOT visualization (saved to `.work/compliance/analyze-cve/{CVE-ID}/callgraph.svg`)
- **Scanner Evidence**: `govulncheck` output, vulnerability findings
- **Mitigation Factors**: Input validation, disabled features, feature flags, security controls

### Step 4: Assign Risk Level

Evaluate all evidence and assign a risk level. The determination should be data-driven, not formula-based.

**HIGH RISK:**
- Call graph shows reachable path to vulnerable function, OR govulncheck confirms vulnerability

**MEDIUM RISK:**
- Package + vulnerable version found in dependencies, usage evidence present but reachability not fully proven

**LOW RISK:**
- Package not in dependencies, OR version not in vulnerable range, OR no reachable path found

**NEEDS REVIEW:**
- Conflicting signals, incomplete analysis, or low-confidence evidence

## Error Handling

### Build Failures
- IF project doesn't compile → Note limitation, skip call graph analysis, rely on other methods

### Missing CVE in govulncheck Database
- IF govulncheck doesn't know about this CVE → Continue with other methods, note gap

### Large Codebases
- IF call graph times out → Follow fallback strategy in call-graph-analysis skill (algorithm fallback, then scope narrowing)

### Incomplete CVE Information
- IF vulnerable function signature unknown → Skip call graph method, rely on dependency and scanner methods

## Integration with Parent Command

This skill is called from Phase 2 of the `/compliance:analyze-cve` command.

**Input:** CVE profile from Phase 1, `--algo` preference from user
**Output:** Risk level, evidence package, confidence assessment
**Next:** Parent command uses risk level to decide whether to generate report and proceed to remediation
