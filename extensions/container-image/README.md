# Container Image Plugin

Container image inspection and analysis tools using skopeo and podman.

## Overview

This plugin provides commands to inspect, analyze, and compare container images from any OCI-compliant registry. It leverages `skopeo` and `podman` to provide detailed insights into image structure, manifest lists, layers, and configuration without requiring full image pulls.

## Features

- **Image Inspection**: Detailed breakdown of image metadata, layers, and configuration
- **Image Comparison**: Compare two images to identify differences
- **Tag Discovery**: List and analyze available tags for a repository

## Commands

### `/container-image:inspect`

Inspect and provide detailed breakdown of a container image.

**Usage:**
```bash
/container-image:inspect <image>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/container-image:inspect quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.20.0-multi
/container-image:inspect registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
/container-image:inspect docker.io/library/nginx@sha256:abc123...
```

**What it shows:**
- Inferred image purpose and context based on metadata analysis
- Image digest and basic metadata
- Architecture and OS information
- Manifest type (single image vs manifest list)
- For multi-arch images: all available platforms with per-platform digests, sizes, and layer counts
- Platform comparison (size ranges, architecture list)
- Size breakdown and layer details
- Configuration (environment, entrypoint, ports, volumes)
- Labels and annotations
- Usage examples for pulling specific platforms

See [commands/inspect.md](commands/inspect.md) for full documentation.

### `/container-image:compare`

Compare two container images to identify differences.

**Usage:**
```bash
/container-image:compare <image1> <image2>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/container-image:compare quay.io/myapp:v1.0.0 quay.io/myapp:v2.0.0
/container-image:compare registry.prod.example.com/myapp:latest registry.staging.example.com/myapp:latest
```

**What it shows:**
- Whether images are identical (digest match)
- Metadata differences (creation date, size)
- Layer analysis (added, removed, modified layers)
- Configuration changes (environment variables, labels, entrypoint)
- Size impact
- Summary of significant changes

See [commands/compare.md](commands/compare.md) for full documentation.

### `/container-image:tags`

List and analyze available tags for a container image repository.

**Usage:**
```bash
/container-image:tags <repository>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/container-image:tags quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
/container-image:tags docker.io/library/nginx
```

**What it shows:**
- All available tags for the repository
- Tag metadata (creation date, size, architecture)
- Tag categorization (version, date-based, special tags)
- Recent tags and update patterns
- Recommendations for tag selection
- Duplicate tags (same digest, different names)

See [commands/tags.md](commands/tags.md) for full documentation.

## Installation

### From the Gemini CLI Extension Marketplace

1. **Add the marketplace** (if not already added):
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add openshift-eng/ai-helpers
   ```

2. **Install the container-image plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install container-image@ai-helpers
   ```

3. **Use the commands**:
   ```bash
   /container-image:inspect quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.20.0-multi
   ```

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

**skopeo** - Primary tool for image inspection

- Check if installed: `which skopeo`
- Installation:
  - RHEL/Fedora: `sudo dnf install skopeo`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install skopeo`
  - macOS: `brew install skopeo`
- Documentation: https://github.com/containers/skopeo

### Optional Tools

**podman** - Additional image analysis capabilities

- Installation:
  - RHEL/Fedora: `sudo dnf install podman`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install podman`
  - macOS: `brew install podman`
- Documentation: https://podman.io/

**dive** - Interactive layer analysis (for `/container-image:compare`)

- Installation: https://github.com/wagoodman/dive
- Provides detailed layer-by-layer exploration

### Registry Authentication

For private registries, authenticate before running commands:

```bash
# Using skopeo
skopeo login registry.example.com

# Using podman (if installed)
podman login registry.example.com
```

Authentication is typically stored at `~/.docker/config.json` or `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`.

## Use Cases

### Development Workflows

1. **Version Selection**: Find the right image version for your deployment
   ```bash
   /container-image:tags quay.io/myapp
   /container-image:inspect quay.io/myapp:v2.1.0
   ```

2. **Multi-Arch Development**: Verify architecture support before deployment
   ```bash
   /container-image:inspect registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
   ```
   The inspect command automatically detects and shows all available platforms for multi-arch images.

3. **Update Analysis**: Understand changes before upgrading
   ```bash
   /container-image:compare myapp:current myapp:latest
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Deployment Issues**: Verify correct image is being used
   ```bash
   /container-image:inspect <failing-image>
   ```

2. **Architecture Mismatches**: Check platform compatibility
   ```bash
   /container-image:inspect <image>
   ```
   For multi-arch images, this will show all available platforms and their digests.

3. **Size Issues**: Identify what's consuming space
   ```bash
   /container-image:inspect <large-image>
   /container-image:compare <old-image> <new-image>
   ```

### Security & Compliance

1. **Image Verification**: Confirm image authenticity via digest
   ```bash
   /container-image:inspect myapp@sha256:abc123...
   ```

2. **Change Tracking**: Document what changed between versions
   ```bash
   /container-image:compare prod:v1.0.0 prod:v1.1.0
   ```

3. **Registry Migration**: Verify images copied correctly
   ```bash
   /container-image:compare source.registry.com/app:v1 dest.registry.com/app:v1
   ```

## Common Workflows

### Upgrading an Application Image

```bash
# 1. List available versions
/container-image:tags quay.io/myapp

# 2. Inspect the new version (shows all architectures if multi-arch)
/container-image:inspect quay.io/myapp:v2.0.0

# 3. Compare with current version
/container-image:compare quay.io/myapp:v1.5.0 quay.io/myapp:v2.0.0
```

### Verifying Multi-Architecture Support

```bash
# 1. Check if image is multi-arch and see all platforms
/container-image:inspect quay.io/myapp:latest

# 2. Inspect specific platform by digest
/container-image:inspect quay.io/myapp@sha256:<arm64-digest>

# 3. Compare platforms
/container-image:compare quay.io/myapp@sha256:<amd64-digest> quay.io/myapp@sha256:<arm64-digest>
```

### Investigating Image Bloat

```bash
# 1. Inspect current image
/container-image:inspect myapp:latest

# 2. Compare with previous version
/container-image:compare myapp:v1.0.0 myapp:latest

# 3. Identify which layers added size
# (Layer analysis in the comparison output)
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Image References

- **Use digests for production**: `myapp@sha256:abc123...` (immutable)
- **Use tags for development**: `myapp:latest` (convenient but mutable)
- **Be specific**: `myapp:v1.2.3` is better than `myapp:v1`

### Multi-Architecture Images

- Use `/container-image:inspect` to check platform support - it automatically detects and displays all available architectures
- Pull specific platforms when needed: `podman pull --platform=linux/arm64 <image>`
- Verify all platforms are updated in manifest lists by comparing platform digests

### Performance

- `skopeo inspect` doesn't pull the full image (fast and efficient)
- For large repositories, `/container-image:tags` may sample tags
- Use `--filter` options to narrow results for large tag lists

### Security

- Always verify image digests match expectations
- Check for unexpected configuration changes with `/container-image:compare`
- Use `/container-image:inspect` to review labels and metadata
