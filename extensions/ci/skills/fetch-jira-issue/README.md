# Fetch JIRA Issue Skill

This skill fetches detailed information about a JIRA issue from the Red Hat JIRA REST API.

## Overview

The `fetch-jira-issue` skill retrieves comprehensive JIRA issue data including:

- Status, priority, and resolution
- Assignee and reporter
- Components and fix versions
- All comments with timestamps
- GitHub PR links extracted from comments
- Automatic progress classification (ACTIVE / STALLED / NEEDS_ATTENTION / RESOLVED)

## Usage

This skill is used internally by CI commands such as `/ci:analyze-regression` and `/ci:check-if-jira-regression-is-ongoing`, but can also be invoked directly.

### Input

- **JIRA Key**: Issue key (e.g., OCPBUGS-74401)
- **JIRA_USERNAME**: Atlassian account email set as environment variable (or passed via `--username`)
- **JIRA_API_TOKEN**: API token set as environment variable (or passed via `--token`)

### Output
