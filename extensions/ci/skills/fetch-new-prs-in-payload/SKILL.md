# Fetch New PRs in Payload

This skill fetches the list of pull requests that are new in a given OpenShift payload tag compared to the previous payload. It tries the Sippy payload diff API first, and falls back to the release controller API when Sippy has not yet ingested the payload (e.g., in-progress or very recent payloads).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Determine what changed between two consecutive payloads
- Identify which PRs were included in a specific payload
- Investigate whether a specific PR or component change landed in a payload
- Correlate a regression or test failure with newly merged PRs
- Build a changelog of what shipped in a payload

The payload tag can be obtained from the `fetch-prowjob-json` skill (`release.openshift.io/tag` annotation) or from release controller pages.

## Prerequisites

1. **Network Access**: Must be able to reach the Sippy API and/or the release controller
   - Sippy: `curl -s https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/api/health`
   - Release controller: `curl -s https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestream/4-stable/latest`
   - No authentication required for either

2. **Python 3**: Python 3.6 or later
   - Check: `python3 --version`
   - Uses only standard library (no external dependencies)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run the Python Script

The skill uses a Python script to fetch and format the payload diff data:

```bash
# Locate the Python script
FETCH_NEW_PRS="${GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT}/skills/fetch-new-prs-in-payload/fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py"
if [ ! -f "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" ]; then
  FETCH_NEW_PRS=$(find ~/.gemini/extensions -type f -path "*/ci/skills/fetch-new-prs-in-payload/fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py" 2>/dev/null | sort | head -1)
fi
if [ -z "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" ] || [ ! -f "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" ]; then echo "ERROR: fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py not found" >&2; exit 2; fi

# Fetch new PRs in JSON format
python3 "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" <payload_tag> --format json

# Or fetch as human-readable summary grouped by component
python3 "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" <payload_tag> --format summary
```

### Step 2: Parse the Output

The script outputs structured JSON data that can be further processed:

```bash
# Store JSON output in a variable for processing
pr_data=$(python3 "$script_path" 4.22.0-0.ci-2026-02-06-195709 --format json)

# Extract specific fields using jq if needed
total=$(echo "$pr_data" | jq '.total_prs')
pr_urls=$(echo "$pr_data" | jq -r '.pull_requests[].url')
components=$(echo "$pr_data" | jq -r '[.pull_requests[].component] | unique[]')

# Find PRs for a specific component
echo "$pr_data" | jq '.pull_requests[] | select(.component == "hypershift")'

# Find PRs with associated bugs
echo "$pr_data" | jq '.pull_requests[] | select(.bug_url != "")'
```

### Step 3: Use the Data

The structured data includes all PR details from the payload diff:

```json
{
  "payload_tag": "4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134",
  "total_prs": 17,
  "pull_requests": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/pull/8594",
      "pull_request_id": "8594",
      "component": "agent-installer-api-server",
      "description": "Create Enhancement Document for 3rd Party CNI / No CNI Support in Assisted Installer",
      "bug_url": "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22584"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/7470",
      "pull_request_id": "7470",
      "component": "hypershift",
      "description": "use InfraStatus.APIPort for custom DNS kubeconfig",
      "bug_url": "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-72258"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

The Python script handles common error cases automatically:

### Case 1: Payload Not Found (404)

```bash
python3 fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py 4.22.0-0.ci-9999-99-99-000000
# Error: Payload '4.22.0-0.ci-9999-99-99-000000' not found.
# Verify the payload tag exists (e.g., 4.22.0-0.ci-2026-02-06-195709).
```

### Case 2: Network Error

```bash
python3 fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py 4.22.0-0.ci-2026-02-06-195709
# Error: Failed to connect to Sippy API: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
# Check network connectivity.
```

### Case 3: Missing Arguments

```bash
python3 fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py
# usage: fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py [-h] [--format {json,summary}] payload_tag
# fetch_new_prs_in_payload.py: error: the following arguments are required: payload_tag
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Success
- `1`: Error (invalid input, API error, network error, etc.)

## Data Sources

The script tries two APIs in order:

1. **Sippy** (primary) — has longer history but only includes completed payloads
2. **Release controller** (fallback) — available immediately for in-progress and recent payloads, but has shorter retention

The output format is identical regardless of which source is used. The fallback is automatic and transparent.

## API Details

### Sippy Endpoint

```text
GET https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/api/payloads/diff?toPayload={payload_tag}
```

### Parameters

- `toPayload` (required): The payload tag to diff against its predecessor (e.g., `4.22.0-0.ci-2026-02-06-195709`)

### Response Schema

The API returns a JSON array of PR objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "created_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "deleted_at": null,
    "url": "https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/7470",
    "pull_request_id": "7470",
    "name": "hypershift",
    "description": "use InfraStatus.APIPort for custom DNS kubeconfig",
    "bug_url": "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-72258"
  }
]
```

**Raw API Fields:**
- `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`: Database metadata (not useful for consumers)
- `url`: Full GitHub pull request URL
- `pull_request_id`: PR number as a string
- `name`: Component name(s) affected by this PR (may contain comma-separated values for multi-component PRs, e.g., `"olm-catalogd, olm-operator-controller"`)
- `description`: PR title/description
- `bug_url`: Associated Jira bug URL (empty string if none)

The Python script remaps `name` to `component` in its output for clarity.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fetch PRs as JSON

```bash
python3 "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" 4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134 --format json
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "payload_tag": "4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134",
  "total_prs": 17,
  "pull_requests": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/pull/8594",
      "pull_request_id": "8594",
      "component": "agent-installer-api-server",
      "description": "Create Enhancement Document for 3rd Party CNI / No CNI Support in Assisted Installer",
      "bug_url": "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-22584"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/pull/5509",
      "pull_request_id": "5509",
      "component": "machine-config-operator",
      "description": "Set `NodeDegraded` MCN condition when node state annotation is set to `Degraded`",
      "bug_url": "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-67229"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Fetch PRs as Summary

```bash
python3 "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" 4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134 --format summary
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
New PRs in payload 4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134
============================================================
Total: 17 new pull requests

```

### Example 3: Use with fetch-prowjob-json Skill

Combine with the `fetch-prowjob-json` skill to get the payload tag from a Prow job, then find what PRs were new in that payload:

```bash
# 1. Get payload tag from prowjob.json (via fetch-prowjob-json skill)
#    payload_tag = metadata.annotations["release.openshift.io/tag"]
#    e.g., "4.22.0-0.ci-2026-02-06-195709"

# 2. Fetch new PRs in that payload
python3 "$FETCH_NEW_PRS" "$payload_tag" --format json
```

## Notes

- Neither API requires authentication for read-only access
- The Python script uses only standard library modules (no external dependencies)
- The previous payload is determined automatically; you only provide the target payload
- Payload tags follow the format: `{version}-0.{stream}-{date}-{time}` (e.g., `4.22.0-0.ci-2026-02-06-195709` or `4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-01-15-114134`)
- The `component` field (called `name` in the raw API) may contain multiple comma-separated component names for PRs that affect multiple components
- PRs without an associated bug will have an empty string for `bug_url`
- An empty response array means no new PRs were found (the payload may be identical to its predecessor)
