description: Stage reverts for high-confidence payload candidates identified by analyze-payload
argument-hint: "<payload-tag>"
---

## Name

ci:payload-revert

## Synopsis

```
/ci:payload-revert <payload-tag>
```

## Description

The `ci:payload-revert` command reads the payload results YAML produced by `/ci:analyze-payload` and stages reverts for all high-confidence candidates (confidence score >= 85) that have not already been reverted.

For each qualifying candidate, it creates a TRT JIRA bug, opens a revert PR, and triggers payload validation jobs using the `stage-payload-reverts` skill.

This command is one of three composable stages in the payload triage pipeline:
1. `/ci:analyze-payload` — produces the payload results YAML
2. `/ci:payload-revert` — stages reverts for HIGH confidence candidates (this command)
3. `/ci:payload-experiment` — opens draft revert PRs for MEDIUM confidence candidates

### Job Triggering Limits

- **Non-aggregated jobs**: Up to 5 total across all candidates
- **Aggregated jobs**: Up to 1 total

When the number of failing jobs across all candidates exceeds these limits, prioritize jobs from higher-confidence candidates first.

## Implementation

1. **Parse the payload tag** from the argument. Extract `version`, `stream`, and `architecture` from the tag (see `analyze-payload` Step 1 for parsing rules).

2. **Read the payload results YAML** using the `payload-results-yaml` skill: Look for `payload-results-{tag}.yaml` in the current working directory. If not found, print an error and exit:
   ```
   Error: Payload results YAML not found for {payload_tag}.
   Run `/ci:analyze-payload {payload_tag}` first to generate it.
   ```

3. **Filter candidates**: Select candidates with `confidence_score >= 85`. Exclude any that already have an action with `status` of `"open"` or `"merged"` (pre-existing revert).

4. **Dispatch to `stage-payload-reverts` skill**: Pass all qualifying candidates with their context (results YAML path, payload tag, version, stream, architecture, release controller URL, and failing jobs). The skill updates the results YAML and HTML report in place. The `trigger-payload-job` skill validates that aggregated jobs have `underlying_job_name` set and skips them with an error if not.

5. **Report results**: Print a summary of actions taken (JIRA tickets created, revert PRs opened, payload jobs triggered).

## Return Value

- Summary of staged reverts with JIRA keys, revert PR URLs, and triggered payload job URLs
- Any errors encountered during staging

## Examples

1. **Stage reverts after analysis**:
   ```
   /ci:analyze-payload 4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-02-25-152806
   /ci:payload-revert 4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-02-25-152806
   ```

## Arguments

- $1: A full payload tag (e.g., `4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-02-25-152806`). Must match the tag used with `/ci:analyze-payload`. (required)

## Skills Used

- `payload-results-yaml`: Reads and updates the payload results YAML
- `stage-payload-reverts`: Creates TRT JIRA bugs, opens revert PRs, triggers payload jobs
- `trigger-payload-job`: Triggers payload jobs and collects URLs
- `revert-pr`: Git revert workflow for creating revert PRs
